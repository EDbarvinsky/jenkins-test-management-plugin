    This plugin updates issues annotated with @JiraTestKey using Test Management and Jira API possibilities.
    Basically the way it works is that the plugin changes Test (issue) status, add corresponding label
    (optional) and leaves basic build information and useful artifacts (titled values, file links) as issue
    comments. Stack traces, screenshots, user added files are attached to issue with adding their links to Report.
    In addition, you can take advantage of clean-up function for expired comments and related to them attachments
    or labels.
